## 🎮 How to Vibe

### Talk Like a Human
- *"Hey, what files are in my home folder?"*
- *"Show me who's eating all my RAM"*
- *"Is port 3000 having a party?"*

### Or Go Full Nerd
- `ls -la`
- `docker ps`
- `htop` (warning: might get trippy)

### Magic Buttons
Just tap and watch:
- 📁 **Show Files** - Peek into directories
- 🧠 **Memory Info** - How's the brain doing?
- 🏃‍♂️ **What's Running?** - Process party list
- 🌍 **Network Check** - Who's connected to the vibe?

---

## 🔐 Security? We Got You!

> *"But what about my passwords?"* 

Bruh, even the dev doesn't know how this thing works! 😂 Your secrets are safer than your browser history. Every command needs your explicit "YOLO" approval before execution.

**Real talk though:**
- ✅ All commands require confirmation
- ✅ Credentials stay local (or in your env)
- ✅ No sneaky business
- ✅ Open source = trust the vibe

## 🎨 The Vibe Philosophy

```
if (boring) {
  addVibes();
  addMoreVibes();
  perfectVibes = true;
}
```

This bot believes that terminal commands don't have to be boring. Every error message is a mini comedy show. Every success is a celebration. Every loading screen is a tiny adventure.

---

## 🛠️ For The Builders

### Add More Vibes
```typescript
// src/ui-helpers.ts
getRandomLoadingMessage(): string {
  return "🎪 The hamsters are spinning the wheels...";
}
```

### Custom Commands
```typescript
// Just vibe with it
const vibeCommands = {
  '🎵 Drop the Bass': 'sudo systemctl restart audio',
  '🌈 Taste the Rainbow': 'ls -la --color=always'
};
